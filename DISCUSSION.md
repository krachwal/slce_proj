# TO DO
- Ideally would want to support combo filters that populate a tag-like list of filters that are being applied at once (logical `AND` would be helpful for specialties, for example) which could be cleared individually ðŸª„  
- Would be great to get a designer to make it pretty... âœ¨ I really should have ripped the styles off of the Solace web presence ðŸ˜¬ ðŸ™ˆ  
- Depending on whether or not the team is into it, could make the migration execution part of the docker-compose and could also roll the web app in to get a more realistic representation of the production environment. As the org grows and there are more services it's nice to have a full integration environment locally when you're working on APIs and multi-service changes.
